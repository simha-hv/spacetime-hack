/**
 * Thumbstick: visible at rest, floating origin in use.
 *
 * Two requirements that pull against each other:
 *
 *  - It has to LOOK like a joystick before anyone touches it. The first version
 *    drew nothing but a faint dashed ring, and only became a stick once you
 *    were already dragging — so the thing you needed to understand only
 *    appeared after you had understood it.
 *  - It has to FEEL like a floating stick. A fixed base gives every grip that
 *    lands slightly off-centre a lurch on the very first frame.
 *
 * So: the base and knob live at a home position and are always drawn. On touch
 * the base slides to wherever the thumb landed and the knob follows it with no
 * transition at all; on release both ease back home.
 *
 * Rendering is synchronous inside the touch handler and never waits for the
 * host to echo anything. The character on the big screen may lag by a round
 * trip; the knob under the thumb must not.
